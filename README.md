This is a console-based Snake game implemented in C++, utilizing linked lists to represent the dynamically growing snake body and hashing techniques to optimize collision detection and food placement. 

The project was designed to reinforce concepts in dynamic memory management, pointer manipulation, and core data structure design while applying them in an interactive gameplay environment.
